# Description
One of the major areas of computer vision is 3D reconstruction of an environment based on given 2D images of its surroudings. This project focuses on **sparse reconstruction** and **dense reconstruction**.

## Sparse reconstruction
**Sparse reconstruction** typically contains a number of points and uses them to describe the objects in question.


## Dense reconstruction
**Dense reconstruction** is more detailed and fine-grained compared to **Sparse reconstruction**
