# Description
This is an **Augmented Reality** application using *planar homographies*. 
<br/>
*Planar homography* is a warp operation that maps pixel coordinates from one camera frame to another of the same points. This usually raises a problem in which 
rdinary least squares is not possible to be used as the projective geometry in this case is of the form x = λHx′. We can bypass such dilemma by applying *Direct Linear Transform*, where the equation is rewritten into homogeneous equations that are solvable using standard least squares method. 
<br/> 
These are the steps to create our AR application:
- Computing Planar Homographies:
	i. Something
	ii. Something else
- Creating Augmented Reality app:
