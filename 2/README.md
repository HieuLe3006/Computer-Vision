# Description
## Part 1:
This is a a CNN that is trained using PyTorch framework on [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) - images are of size 3x32x32. The result will be a deep net architecture that can be used to classify images into 100 different categories. In particular, the CNN is basically a **BaseNet** that has a baseline accuracy of approximately 23%, which is then further improved by  
The initial **BaseNet** consists: 
 has an accuracy of approximately 23%
