# Description
This is a a CNN that is trained using PyTorch framework on [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) - images are of size 3x32x32. The result will be a deep net architecture that can be used to classify images into 100 different categories. In particular, the CNN that we used in this project consists of a provided (pretrained) **BaseNet**    
The initial **BaseNet** consists: 
 has an accuracy of approximately 23%
