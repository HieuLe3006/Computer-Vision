## Project Descrition
- Project 1: A numeric character recognition system that is implemented based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and trained on MNIST dataset. 
- Project 2: 2 parts:
	- 1: A CNN based on **BaseNet** neural network that has a baseline accurasy of 23% and can be use to categorize objects (i.e., vehicle, birds, etc.). The model's accuracy is improved by adding additional layers to it.     
	- 2: A bird recognition system that can be used to identify more than 200 differnt types of birds. 
- Project 3: An AR application using homographies to wrap a short clip of Po in Kunfu Panda onto a cover page of Harry Potter and detect any book cover and change it to cover of a Harry Potter book.  
- Project 4: 3D reconstruction of 2D images of an environment with **sparse reconstruction** and **dense construction**
