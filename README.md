# Computer-Vision

## Project 1
This is a numeric character recognition system that is implemented based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and trained on MNIST dataset. 
<br>
The neural network consists of these layers:
    - Inner Product layer
    - Pooling layer
    - Convolution layer
    - ReLU
</br>
There are 2 main steps: **Forward Pass** - the variables are forward propagated through the network and **Back Propagation** - performs a backward pass while adjusting the parameters whenever
